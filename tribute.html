            <h3>Some key movements in his life</h3>
            <ul >
                <li class="list"><p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam famously knows as <b>Missle Man of India</b>was 
                    born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.</p></li>
                <li class="list"><p>He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                     <a href="#">Defence Research and Development Organisation</a> (DRDO) 
                    and <a href="#">Indian Space Research Organisation </a>(ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                     space programme and military missile development efforts.</p></li>
                <li class="list"><p>He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology</p></li>
                <li class="list"><p>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, 
                    the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p></li>
                <li class="list"><p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                     Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as 
                     the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
                     writing and public service after a single term.</p></li>
                <li class="list"><p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died 
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.</p></li>
